# JPC

JPC, also known as the Java Program compiler, is a Library + standalone program
designed to compile Micro-Assembly to Lower/Higher level Programming languages 
like:
- C
- C++
- QBE (for native assembly with Glibc)

JPC uses java reflection and annotations to provide multi language support while
providing java's (compile once, run anywhere) motto.



## required(ness thingies)
- Minimum of java 17
- QBE: to test things out if needed.
- Micro-Assembly experience: minimum of V1 spec compliance (just kidding XD)

## getting started.

getting started is easy.

clone the repository
```shell
git clone https://github.com/fy-nite/JPC

recommended to use HTTPS as it just works instead of fussing around with SSH.
